# CGP Rip (WEB)
Convert an online CGP book to .pdf (not finished yet). Use `webpack` to compile and run the api in the background

## How it works
It downloads the background (jpg/png) and text (svg) of each page using your session id (you must own the book). Then, it combines them to form the actual page.

## To Do
- [ ] Add the .svg to PDF
